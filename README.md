# cpp-math-mpg-pay

This is a C++ console application that performs basic arithmetic operations, calculates Miles Per Gallon (MPG) for car trips, and computes simple payroll for employees. The program also allows saving and viewing results in text files.
## Technologies Used
- C++ (console application) I used Code Blocks for this project.
- Standard Template Library (STL) for vectors and file handling

## Features
- Basic arithmetic: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide
- MPG calculator: Input trips, calculate MPG, save/load from file
- Simple payroll calculator: Input employees, calculate pay, save/load from file
- Console-based menu system
- ## How to Run

## How to Run
To run this program, first make sure you have a C++ compiler installed, such as g++, Visual Studio, or Code::Blocks. Clone or download the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project folder using a terminal or command prompt. Compile the code by running a command like `g++ -o calculator main.cpp` (replace `main.cpp` with your filename if different). Once compiled, run the program using `./calculator` on Mac/Linux or `calculator.exe` on Windows. The program will prompt you to enter your name, then display a menu with options for basic arithmetic operations, MPG calculations, and simple payroll calculations. Follow the on-screen instructions to input numbers for arithmetic, enter car trips and gas used for MPG, or enter employee hours and rates for payroll. You can also view and save results to text files (`mpg.txt` for MPG data and `pay.txt` for payroll data), making it easy to review your calculations later. Simply choose the menu option corresponding to the task you want to perform, and follow the prompts until you select "Exit" to close the program.
